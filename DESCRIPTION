Description: The 'L-BFGS' algorithm is a popular optimization algorithm for unconstrained optimization problems. 
  'Blaze' is a high-performance 'C++' math library for dense and sparse arithmetic. 
  This package provides a simple interface to the 'L-BFGS' algorithm and allows users to optimize 
  their objective functions with 'Blaze' vectors and matrices in 'R' and 'Rcpp'.
